        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>Listed below are some of the skills that I have developed throughout my college career by taking a variety of different classes. Some of the main classes that I want to highlight are Databases, Introduction to Programming, Business Programming Languages, and Supervision Skills. Each one of these classes gave me the chance to learn new skills like SQL, C#, HTML, and learning how to be a good manager/supervisor.</p>
