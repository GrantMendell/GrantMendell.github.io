        <p>This page highlights a major project that I have worked on throughout my college career. This was a milestone project that I completed when I took a Databases class in the Spring of 2019 of my junior year at OU. I was on a team with 3 other people and the project consisted of writing SQL Queries, Creating an ERD, and working with Normalization and Denormalization. Overall, this was a great project and I got the chance to learn alot of new things and develop relationships with my teammates.</p>
